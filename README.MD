Welcome to Fantasy & Nature, my first Java 1.18.2 minecraft mod
-------------------------------------------
The contents of the mod will range from tomatos to ghosts to penguins and more.
I'm planning to add a wide variety of weapons too so there'll be many a way to defeat the new enemies.
Building is an essential part of Minecraft so there will be new blocks to experiment with.

The world gen features such as the ghost trees will be available in current biomes, so there'll be no need to start a new world after updates.

Since this is my first mod please excuse some textures, I'm still proud of the new Ghostly Pickaxe and the Ghost planks however.
