Welcome to Fantasy & Nature, my first Java 1.18.2 minecraft mod
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This mod is still a massive WIP, and it is far from what I want it to be.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New Spell tomes underway.

An Anti-Dimension is the next WIP thing.

Currently contains:
> 5+ weapons, inlcuding but not limited to a saber, a cleaver, a fiery sword and more
> 2 new tools, which include a hammer that mines 3x3 if you face north or south (will be updated soon)
> 2 armor sets, squirrel and forest
> (Squirrel armor has a jump boost effect once you wear the full set, this makes it handy for early game exploration)
> 2 Wood types with their fence and gate variants soon to be available
> New crops, tomatos and grapes.
> New ore, Ghost ore
> New Flowers & Trees
> New Food items, such as BANANA
> New arrow types
> Some more items
> Much more to come!
 

This mod is intended to be used alongside other content-providing mods as it is currently not big enough to be used on its own.

-----------------------------------FEEDBACK----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 

Feedback is always appreciated, you can do so either here or on the github issue tracker:
https://github.com/S1lentwr4ith/FaN
 

Weapon damage is subject to change, as is the food & saturation value, as always feedback concerning those values is appreciated.
 
Once this mod gets a bit of downloads, I'll make a discord so it'll be easier to see and implement suggestions from you guys. Or keep track of those pesky bugs.
 
This mod should not conflict with any other mod out there.
Please do enjoy this mod, I will continue to work hard and make it great.
